# Fair Credit Risk Assessment

**MSc Dissertation | Sheffield Hallam University | MSc Big Data Analytics | 2026**

## About
Credit data is highly sensitive and difficult to access for research due to strict 
privacy regulations (GDPR). Synthetic data is increasingly promoted as a solution, 
but does it actually work?

This dissertation investigates whether synthetic data generated by AI models can 
safely replace real customer credit data in machine learning models without 
compromising predictive accuracy, statistical fidelity, or fairness across 
demographic groups.

## What Makes This Research Different
Most existing research only tests accuracy. This dissertation evaluates synthetic 
data across four dimensions simultaneously:
- Statistical fidelity (does it look like real data?)
- Predictive performance (do models trained on it perform well?)
- Generalisation (do those models hold up on real test data?)
- Fairness (does it preserve or distort outcomes across demographic groups?)

## Key Findings
- Synthetic data is not a drop-in replacement for real credit data
- Statistical similarity does not guarantee model reliability
- Fairness outcomes do not automatically improve with synthetic data
- CTGAN outperformed Gaussian Copula in preserving fairness properties
- Evaluation must be multi-dimensional - accuracy alone is insufficient

## Technologies
Python, CTGAN, Gaussian Copula, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, EBM (Explainable 
Boosting Machine), SHAP, LIME, Fairlearn, SciPy, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Regulatory Context
Research aligned with GDPR, UK FCA AI Guidelines, and EU AI Act requirements 
for high-risk AI systems in financial services.
